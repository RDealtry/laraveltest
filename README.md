Test for laravel

Followed https://itsolutionstuff.com/post/laravel-56-crud-application-for-starterexample.html
but changed "products" to "mytest" so that all the changes were easy to spot.
It builds a basic CRUD system in laravel using the Yajra datatables library 
I've used it since to build multiple CRUD tables but replaced mytest with whatever else I needed and linked them where necessary.
